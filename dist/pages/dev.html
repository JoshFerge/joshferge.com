<h1>Developer Experience Improvements</h1>
<p>Here are a few tips I've picked up that can increase your development speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increase your key repeat speed.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Mac, open your search (CMD-Space), and type in keyboard. Open the
keyboard settings</li>
<li>Set &quot;Key repeat speed&quot; and &quot;Delay until repeat&quot; all the way to the right.</li>
<li>This will allow you to scroll much faster using left/right arrow, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use quick text shortcuts for moving around. These generally work in most
inputs / terminals / code editors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-ArrowKeys to quickly scroll across per-word</li>
<li>Ctrl-A to go the beginning of input / line</li>
<li>Ctrl-E to go to the end of an input / line</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
