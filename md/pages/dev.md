# Developer Experience Improvements

Here are a few tips I've picked up that can increase your development speed:

- Increase your key repeat speed.
  - In Mac, open your search (CMD-Space), and type in keyboard. Open the
    keyboard settings
  - Set "Key repeat speed" and "Delay until repeat" all the way to the right.
  - This will allow you to scroll much faster using left/right arrow, etc.

- Use quick text shortcuts for moving around. These generally work in most
  inputs / terminals / code editors.
  - Alt-ArrowKeys to quickly scroll across per-word
  - Ctrl-A to go the beginning of input / line
  - Ctrl-E to go to the end of an input / line
